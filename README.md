AppLock is a simple SwiftUI framework that makes it easy to create a PinCode user interface. It provides a struct, `AppLockView`, that can be shown inside a view or a sheet for better user experience.

 Natively, Apple only provides <b>Touch ID</b> and <b>Face ID</b> as authentication mechanisms and only brings <b>Passcode</b> when authentication with those ones have failed. The goal here was to provide a fully fledged Component that can be customized and reuse with ease.


## Usage

You should create an instance of `AppLockView` with three parameters: the pin to check against, a boolean flag to indicate whether or not you want AppLockView to provide an Error UI, and a closure that will be called when a result is ready. This closure must accept a `Result<Bool, UnlockError>`, where the bool is the indicator of a matching that was found on success and `UnlockError` will be either `badPin`.

**Important:** AppLockView *requires* a project with a version greater or equal to `14.0`


## Examples

Here's some example code to create an AppLock view that prints when the pin matched code.

```swift
AppLockView(pincode: .init("1975")) { result  in
    switch result {
    case .success(_):
        print("Match pin code")
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

Your completion closure is probably where you want to dismiss the `AppLockView`.

Here's an example on how to present the AppLockview as a sheet and how we can pass to the next view in a NavigationView when pin code has matched:

```swift
struct AppLockExampleView: View {
    @State var isPresentingLocker = false
    @State var matchedCode: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack(spacing: 10) {
                if matchedCode {
                    NavigationLink("Next page", destination: NextView(), isActive: .constant(true)).hidden()
                }
                Button("Unlock App") {
                    self.isPresentingLocker = true
                }
                .sheet(isPresented: $isPresentingLocker) {
                    self.appLockSheet
                }
                Text("Unlock the app to begin")
            }

        }
    }

    var appLockSheet : some View {
        AppLockView(
            pincode: .init("2021"),
            completion: { result in
                if case .success(_) = result {
                    self.matchedCode = true
                    self.isPresentingLocker = false
                }
            }
        )
    }
}
```
